GUI for FRC Vision 

## How to use

Swap frames by pressing the three buttons on the left. The sliders underneath the frame are for HSV. First three are low values and second group of three are high values. Play around with these sliders until you find the right color detection. Make sure to adjust sliders on the right to accurately detect the object. To take screenshots, enter path and click on the screenshot button. If no path is specified, image will be saved to current directory.
